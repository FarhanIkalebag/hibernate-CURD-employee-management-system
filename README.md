# Hibernate Employee Management System

A console-based Employee Management System built using **Java** and **Hibernate ORM**, demonstrating complete **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations with a **MySQL** database.  
This project focuses on core Hibernate concepts such as entity mapping, session handling, and transaction management.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add new employee records to the database
- Retrieve employee details using employee ID
- Update existing employee information
- Delete employee records
- Console-driven user interaction
- Persistent storage using Hibernate ORM

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **Hibernate ORM**
- **JPA Annotations**
- **MySQL**
- **Maven**
- **JDBC**

## 🧪 Core Hibernate Concepts Implemented
- `@Entity`, `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue`, `@Column`
- Hibernate `SessionFactory`, `Session`
- Transaction management
- ORM-based database interaction
- Object-to-table mapping

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Configure MySQL database and update credentials in `hibernate.cfg.xml`
3. Run the `App.java` file
4. Use the console menu to perform CRUD operations

---

## 📌 Use Case
This project demonstrates how Hibernate ORM simplifies database operations by eliminating boilerplate JDBC code and enabling object-oriented persistence in Java applications.

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- DAO layer implementation
- Exception handling improvements
- Logging using Log4j
- Spring Boot integration
- REST API exposure

---

## 👨‍💻 Author
Developed using Java & Hibernate ORM as part of backend development practice.
